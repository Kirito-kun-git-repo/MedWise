# ProPage Component Tests

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite for the Pro/Pricing page component (`src/app/pro/page.tsx`).

## Test Coverage

### Authentication and Authorization Tests
- ✅ Redirects unauthenticated users to home page
- ✅ Allows authenticated users to access the page
- ✅ Checks for `ai_basic` plan
- ✅ Checks for `ai_pro` plan
- ✅ Correctly determines `hasProPlan` for users with `ai_basic`
- ✅ Correctly determines `hasProPlan` for users with `ai_pro`
- ✅ Correctly determines `hasProPlan` for users with neither plan
- ✅ Correctly determines `hasProPlan` for users with both plans

### Component Rendering Tests
- ✅ Renders Navbar component
- ✅ Renders main heading "Unlock Premium AI Dental Care"
- ✅ Renders "Upgrade to Pro" badge
- ✅ Renders description text about AI consultations
- ✅ Renders CrownIcon
- ✅ Renders "Choose Your Plan" heading
- ✅ Renders pricing section description
- ✅ Renders PricingTable component
- ✅ Renders security assurance text (bank-level encryption)

### Layout and Structure Tests
- ✅ Applies correct max-width container class
- ✅ Has proper spacing classes on main container
- ✅ Renders gradient background on hero section
- ✅ Has animated pulse effect on badge

### Edge Cases and Error Handling Tests
- ✅ Handles `currentUser` returning `null`
- ✅ Handles `currentUser` returning `undefined`
- ✅ Handles auth function errors gracefully
- ✅ Handles user with minimal data
- ✅ Handles multiple plan checks correctly

### Console Logging Tests
- ✅ Logs `hasProPlan` status to console
- ✅ Logs correct boolean value for `hasProPlan`

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Completes full authentication and rendering flow for authenticated user
- ✅ Handles complete flow for user with pro plan

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run only ProPage tests
npm test src/app/pro/__tests__/page.test.tsx
```

## Test Structure

Each test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:
1. **Arrange**: Set up mocks and test data
2. **Act**: Execute the component/function
3. **Assert**: Verify expected outcomes

## Mocked Dependencies

- `@clerk/nextjs/server` - Authentication functions
- `@clerk/nextjs` - UI components (PricingTable, UserButton)
- `@/components/NavBar` - Navigation component
- `lucide-react` - Icon components
- `next/navigation` - Next.js routing functions
- `next/image` - Next.js Image component

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
- Authenticated user accesses the Pro page
- User sees pricing options and can upgrade

### Edge Cases
- Unauthenticated user is redirected
- User with no plan sees all options
- User with pro plan still sees the page (for plan changes)
- Authentication service errors are handled

### Failure Conditions
- Auth service unavailable
- Invalid user data
- Missing user information

## Notes

- All tests use Vitest as the test runner
- React Testing Library is used for component testing
- Server Components are tested by rendering the resolved JSX
- Mocks ensure tests are isolated and fast
